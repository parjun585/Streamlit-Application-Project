# Objective:

### This Python-based project develops a web application using Streamlit to analyze DNA sequences. The application provides functionalities to:
- Reverse a DNA sequence.
- Complement a DNA sequence.
- Calculate the reverse complement of a DNA sequence.
- Determine base composition (counts of A, T, C, G).
- Calculate AT and GC content.

  
### Functionality:
- Users can input a DNA sequence and obtain the following results:
- The original DNA sequence in uppercase.
- The reversed sequence.
- The complemented sequence.
- The reverse complement sequence.
- A table displaying base counts, AT content, and GC content.

  
### Technology Stack:

- Python
- Streamlit

This tool can be utilized in various biological and computational biology research areas, including: Bioinformatics, Molecular biology, Genetic engineering, DNA sequence analysis
